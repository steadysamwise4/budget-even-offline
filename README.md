## Description <a name="description"></a>
<sub>_***Built With:***_</sub> <sub>JavaScript,HTML,CSS,ES6,Node,MongoDB,Express,PWA, Heroku</sub> </br>
I enhanced this app to have offline functionality and to be more of a PWA. This was done using a service worker, indexedDB, and a manifest.json file. The app will register transactions made offline and then automatically upload them when connected to the internet again. A user is able to install this onto their desktop or their phone much like a phone App. I was given starter code of a basically functioning app. The excercise was to add the PWA like functionality. It went very well. Everything is working great. It was a great experience to be introduced to some newer technologies which are gaining in popularity. The database used is MongoDB and it is deployed live on Heroku.
